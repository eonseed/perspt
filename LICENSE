Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application.

“Application” is defined as any work that makes use of an interface
provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.

Defining an interface as “a use of an interface” is not intended to
limit the meaning of the term “interface” as it is used in the GNU GPL.

“Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions that, used in isolation, are based on the Application,
and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for the Combined Work to be installed and
run correctly, but excluding the Library.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work that combines the Library with an
Application (or with a modified version of the Application), and you
must follow the terms of the GNU GPL for conveying the covered work,
save that you may convey the Combined Work under terms of your choice
that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Combined Work that constitute the Application, and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
   include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as
   well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and
   this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code under terms of
       your choice, or
    1) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source as a User Product, and
       the Corresponding Application Code under terms of your choice, or
    2) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source as a User Product, and
       the Corresponding Application Code as a User Product, and
       include a prominent notice in the Combined Work that the
       user is provided with the Minimal Corresponding Source and
       Corresponding Application Code, and that the user can
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version
       of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work.

2. Exception to Section 6 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a Combined Work that includes material covered under
the GNU GPL, but which is not part of the Library, under terms of your
choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification
of the portions of the Combined Work that are not part of the Library,
and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
   include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as
   well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and
   this license document.

3. No Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

4. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5. Interpretation of Sections 1 and 2.

If the permissions granted in sections 1 and 2 conflict with the
conditions set forth in the GNU GPL, the permissions granted in
sections 1 and 2 shall prevail.
