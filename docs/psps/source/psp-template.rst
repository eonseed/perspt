   PSP Writing Guidelines
   =====================
   
   REQUIRED SECTIONS (every PSP must have these):
   • Abstract - Brief 1-2 sentence summary
   • Motivation - Why this change is needed
   • Proposed Changes - What you're proposing (with Functional Specification)
   • Rationale - Why this approach vs alternatives
   • Backwards Compatibility - Impact on existing users
   
   CONDITIONAL SECTIONS (include if applicable):
   • UI/UX Design - Required for interface changes
   • Technical Specification - Required for implementation details  
   • Accessibility Considerations - Required for UI/UX changes
   
   OPTIONAL SECTIONS (include if helpful):
   • Reference Implementation - Prototypes, demos, examples
   • Open Issues - Unresolved questions needing community input
   
   QUALITY CHECKLIST:
   ✓ Addresses a single, focused problem
   ✓ Provides clear user benefit
   ✓ Considers TUI constraints and patterns
   ✓ Includes specific examples or use cases
   ✓ Discusses implementation feasibility
   ✓ Documents decision rationale

========
Abstract
========

**[REQUIRED]** A brief 1-2 sentence summary of the proposal and its impact on users.

*Example: "This PSP proposes adding keyboard shortcuts for common file operations to improve navigation efficiency in Perspt's file browser interface."*

==========
Motivation
==========

**[REQUIRED]** Explain the problem this PSP solves and why the change is necessary.

**What user need or pain point does this address?**

* Current situation and limitations
* Specific user scenarios that are difficult or impossible
* Evidence of community interest (links to issues, discussions, requests)

*Template: "Currently, users cannot [specific action] when [specific situation], which forces them to [workaround]. This affects [user group] who [frequency/severity of impact]."*

================
Proposed Changes
================

.. rubric:: Functional Specification

**[REQUIRED]** Detailed description of the new functionality or changes to existing functionality.

**Behavioral Changes:**
* What will be different for users?
* How will the feature work step-by-step?
* What are the expected inputs, outputs, and error conditions?

.. rubric:: UI/UX Design

**[REQUIRED FOR UI CHANGES]** Description of changes to the user interface or user experience.
This section is especially important for Perspt as a TUI application.

**User Goals:** What will users be able to achieve?

**Interaction Flow:** How will users interact with this feature?

* Key bindings and navigation patterns
* Screen layouts and visual flow
* Error handling and user feedback
* Integration with existing UI elements

**Visual Design:** Describe changes to the interface:

* Layout changes and component positioning  
* Color schemes and highlighting approaches
* Text formatting and typography choices
* Visual feedback and state indicators

**Accessibility Considerations:** **[REQUIRED FOR UI CHANGES]** How will this impact accessibility?

* Screen reader compatibility and announcements
* Color blindness considerations (avoid color-only cues)
* Keyboard navigation and focus management  
* Terminal capability requirements and fallbacks

.. rubric:: Technical Specification

**[CONDITIONAL]** Required if the PSP involves implementation details and architecture considerations.

* **Architecture:** How does this integrate with Perspt's current architecture?
* **Performance:** Expected performance impact and characteristics
* **Dependencies:** New dependencies or changes to existing ones
* **Configuration:** New configuration options or format changes
* **Data Structures:** New types or modifications to existing structures
* **API Changes:** Command-line interface or internal API modifications

=========
Rationale
=========

**[REQUIRED]** Why this particular approach? What alternatives were considered?

**Design Decision Rationale:**

* Primary reasons for choosing this design approach
* Key benefits and trade-offs considered
* How this aligns with Perspt's design philosophy
* Evidence of community consensus or support

**Alternatives Considered:**

* Alternative 1: Brief description and why it was not chosen
* Alternative 2: Brief description and why it was not chosen
* Alternative 3: Brief description and why it was not chosen

**UI/UX Design Rationale:** (If applicable)

* Why these particular interaction patterns?
* How does this improve the user experience?
* Accessibility considerations in the design choice

=======================
Backwards Compatibility
=======================

**[REQUIRED]** How does this affect existing users and their workflows?

**User Impact:**

* Will existing workflows be affected?
* Do users need to learn new interaction patterns?
* Are there any breaking changes to existing functionality?

**Configuration Impact:**

* Will existing configuration files need updates?
* Is there a migration path for existing settings?
* What happens to deprecated configuration options?

**Migration Strategy:**

* What steps do users need to take to adopt this change?
* Can migration be automated or assisted?
* What's the timeline for any deprecation of old features?

======================
Reference Implementation
======================

**[OPTIONAL]** Links to prototypes, code, or demonstrations.

**Prototype Links:**

* Link to PR, branch, or gist with working implementation
* Link to demo repository or standalone example
* References to related issues or discussions

**Demo Materials:**

* Screenshots showing the new feature in action
* GIF recordings demonstrating user interactions  
* Terminal output examples showing command usage
* Configuration file examples with new options

**Implementation Notes:**

* Key technical implementation details
* Code organization and structure approach
* Testing strategy and coverage
* Documentation updates required

**Asset Storage:**

Visual assets (screenshots, diagrams, mockups) should be stored in `docs/psps/source/psp-XXXX/` 
where XXXX is this PSP's number. Reference them in the PSP using relative paths.

============
Open Issues
============

**[OPTIONAL]** Unresolved questions that need community input or further discussion.

* **Question 1:** Specific technical or design question needing resolution
* **Question 2:** Areas where community feedback would be valuable  
* **Question 3:** Implementation details that require further investigation
* **Question 4:** Potential future enhancements to consider
